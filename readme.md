# TypeScript Practice from Colt Steele

Practicing TypeScript from Colt Steele's course on Udemy.

You can download the files and remove the comments if you want to run the code.

This is just a repository that consists of my practice and has multiple files with implementations for a lot of stuff.

No way a commerical grade application or even a small project.

Plain Practice.
